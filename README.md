# create-folder-structure

This tool is to make a command line tool that will take as input a start date and an end date and will create a directory (folder) tree structure on disk with a distinct root directory for each year in the range specified.  Each year directory should have sub directories for each month and each month should have subdirectories for each day within that month. 

The tool should allow for an optional argument to allow the user of your tool to indicate that they would like a keep file created in each directory and if the user so indicates, please ensure that a file with the name “.keep” (note the leading period) is placed in each and every created directory.
